Let's install the required dependencies for the frontend dashboard. Run these commands in your frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material
npm install recharts date-fns
```

These commands will install:
1. Material-UI and its dependencies for the UI components
2. Recharts for creating charts
3. date-fns for date formatting

After installing these packages, the import errors should be resolved and the dashboard should work properly. The dashboard includes:

1. A summary section showing total users and notes
2. A bar chart showing notes created in the last 30 days
3. A searchable and sortable table of users with their note statistics

You can access the dashboard at `/dashboard` after logging in as an admin user. The backend is already set up with the required API endpoints and they're protected with the `IsAdminUser` permission class.

Let me know if you need any clarification or run into other issues!
